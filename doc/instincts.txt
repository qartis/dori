====Instincts=====
---Signal--
-when signal is poor, do something
---Power---
- automatically position arm for best solar panel usage
- selectively power up/down nodes based on current supply
- phone home with coords if power too low

---Sensor--
- take pictures of animals when they're detected

-- Heat --
- use temperature data to turn on/off heaters

-- Logging --
- when log reaches critical size, send it off to gateway

-- Redundancy --
 - Detect when modem is unavailable and switch to the other one, send a message
 - maintain list of live nodes (responsive) and report when one fails
 - 'sip' time data from different sources and update clock
 
-- Motion --
 - avoid objects when sensed with ultra sonics
 - detect deviation between actual position and projected position
