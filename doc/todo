Table view
    X kill live support
    X add local db support
    X export to CSV
        X dump current table to selected file
        X add Enter key handling for save dialog
    X sparklines (graph previews) under column headers
    X make sparkline jump to row
    select from log database,
    make sparklines vertically resizable
    ability to launch graphing tool with current dataset,

Graphing tool,
    support multiple datasets,
    set x, y for each dataset,
    tries to guess X axis on dataset load,

Site editor
    Iteration 1:
      X * from DORI's position, draw everything in terms of meters
      X * write mouse cursor's current distance away from dori
      X * grid to show scale (to the nearest half a meter),
      X * each site object will store site id and distance away from site origin in meters
      X * box drag selection
      X * change colours after placement
      X * move multiple selections
      X * add circles

    Iteration 2:
    X add zoom support
    X panning + Zooming,
    * add window resizing support
    * pointer to DORI
    * kill diagonal line
    * add crosshair with meter labels
    * fix scaling zoom bug - if you're zoomed
    * fix zoom bouncing
    * draw more rings (make the square that approximates the ring bigger)
    * polygon tool
    * zoom into / out of middle of screen

    Iteration 3:
    * build the sidebar - put the toolbar into it
    * hierarchy by type of object,
    * text objects,
    * laser data,
    * photo info data (fov),
    * time (arrival, departure)
    * grouping
    * locking objects
    * Markers: drawing lines that show measurement distance, ghost dori

tk
    X sends its rowid for each table (records + logs) to gateway on execution, gateway sends back records with higher row id,
    X store database on disk, not memory,
    sync up files (audio, pictures) with tk

gateway
    sync up files (audio, pictures) with gateway
    preprocess log files, insert into log table

status screen:
    based on the most current data
    checkmarks to enable/disable widgets,
    colour gauges based on freshness,
    widgets: compass, dori's orientation in 3d visualization and gauges (airplane cockpit), last known battery level, temperature, humidity, position in the world, last captured image, node uptime
