fix GSM modem's broken sim card slot

debug 23K256 hardware: fried chip? high spi capacitance?
the code on node #8 works, the code on node #10 doesn't, same hardware

need to decide how to handle a total packet timeout: tell the mcp2515 to abort the send? we're not getting any acks whatsoever..
