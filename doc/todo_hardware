fix GSM modem's broken sim card slot

debug 23K256 hardware: fried chip? high spi capacitance?
the code on node #8 works, the code on node #10 doesn't, same hardware

need to decide how to handle a total packet timeout: tell the mcp2515 to abort the send? we're not getting any acks whatsoever..

pick up TI level converters from fedex

current GSM bitrate is 6.6 bytes/sec. send 10 packets at a time to get better use out of TCP?

modema needs to be powered from 4.5v otherwise its serial level dips too low. run its serial signals through a level converter?

give modema node ability to hard reboot the sim900
