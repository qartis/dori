SCK: SCK via level converter's channel 1
MISO: MISO via level converter's channel 2
MOSI: MOSI via level converter's channel 3
CS: D7 via level converter's channel 4
SNAP: D6 via level converter's channel 5
POWER: D5 via diodes
D4: relay control, LOW enables sd power, HIGH enables camera power

when D4 is high:
    relay turns off
    3.3v power rail turns off
    I want to power the sd card with 3.3v
    camera gets no power
    level converter gets power
    
when D4 is low:
    relay turns on
    3.3v power rail turns on
    I want to power the camera with 3.3v, not the sd card at all
    camera gets power
    level converter gets no power



camera:
    camera gets power
    sd gets no power
    level converter gets no voltage input

    SPI lines are HI-Z

node:
    camera gets no power
    sd card gets power
    levelconverter gets voltage input

    SPI lines go through levelconverter
